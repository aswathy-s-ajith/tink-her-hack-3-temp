### Project Description
IssueWiz is an AI-powered platform designed to lower the barrier to entry for open-source contributions by providing intelligent issue analysis, personalized recommendations, and contextual documentation. The system helps both newcomers and experienced developers navigate complex codebases and find suitable issues to work on.


### The Problem statement
Contributing to open-source projects can be daunting, especially for beginners. The complexity of understanding codebases, identifying relevant files, and navigating through sparse or overwhelming documentation creates barriers to entry .

### The Solution
IssueWiz simplifies this process by providing the following:

- **Issue Analysis Engine** : Analyzes issues, identifies relevant files, and generates contextual documentation with interactive guidance.
- **Skill-Based Issue Matcher** : Matches users' skills with suitable issues, providing ranked recommendations for both learning and contribution.
- **Interactive Learning Assistant** : Offers real-time, AI-driven assistance for understanding code, troubleshooting, and improving development practices.
By lowering these barriers, IssueWiz makes open-source contributions more accessible and engaging for developers of all levels.
